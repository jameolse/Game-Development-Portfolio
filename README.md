You are the last of a fleet defenders attempting to save the Earth from a barrage of terrifying planet gods. The survival of humanity rides on your shoulders. Use the mouse to move, and click to shoot. Get powerups that turn you into a ball of pure energy, making you effectively a giant laser. Remember that with every shot you fire, the planet gods grow larger in number. Fire every shot sparingly.
